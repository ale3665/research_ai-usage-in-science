    Main function to read a Parquet file, process its contents, and generate HTML files.

    This function performs the following steps:
    1. Resolves the input and output paths.
    2. Checks if the input path points to a valid file and the output path points to a valid directory.
    3. Reads a Parquet file into a DataFrame.
    4. Iterates over the DataFrame rows and creates an HTML file for each row using BeautifulSoup to prettify the HTML content.
    5. Displays a progress bar indicating the creation of HTML files.
